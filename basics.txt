pandas is a python package
So think of it as a folder which has core,io,plotting,__init__.py

Classes of pandas
pd.DataFrame
pd.Series
pd.Index as well

How to create object?

df=pd.DataFrame({"name":["Swaraj","Sahoo"],"age":[20,25]})

# In the above code we have created a dataframe object

Then using the object, we can call the functions

df.head()
df.shape

df.describe()
